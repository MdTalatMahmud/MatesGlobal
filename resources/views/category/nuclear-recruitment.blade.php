                            <p>Nowadays, climate change is a burning issue all over the world. To fight global warming, it’s been necessary to develop and use nuclear power.</p>
                            <p>According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Nuclear power will make an important contribution to lower emissions of greenhouse gases while providing the exponentially vast volumes of electricity required for global economic growth. According to the World Nuclear Association (WNA) report, in 2017, approximately 450 of the world's nuclear power plants produced 10% of the planet's electricity.</p>
                            <p>There are also estimates that 50 plants are currently being installed in 15 countries, including Russia, China, India, and the United Arab Emirates. Clearly, there is a significant investment in the nuclear sector. The future of the nuclear sector has been predicted so bright. Most of the investments are to use in Asia. Mates Global has worked with energy firms and those in the infrastructure and process industries.</p>
